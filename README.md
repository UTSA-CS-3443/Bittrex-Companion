# Bittrex-Companion

Application used to assist beginners in trading cryptocurrencies and provide introductory 
algorithmic-trading-base recommendations.

Before running, please ensure you have an internet-enabled network connection.

We will provide you with a generic Bittrex Account API Key Pair for operating the application.

Because of the currency-based nature of this application, the buy and sell access for the API keys has not been enabled.

Should you wish to BUY and SELL cryptocurrencies you would need to sign up for a Bittrex.com account, enable your own 
API Keys with Buy and Sell functions activated.

***Step 1:***

Run Main.java

You will see options to either "Login" or "Register".  Choose "Register".

***Step 2:***

For convenience, we have pre-populated the API Key pair fields with a key that will work for you.

Fill out the other fields and click register.  

***Step 3:***

Once registered, click "Login" and enter your "Username" and "Password" that you made in Step 2.

***Step 4:***

The main window will now open, showing two tables.  The table below "Opportunities" label is populated based upon
the algorithmic-trading principles we have implemented.

Click on any coin to view that coin pair in more detail.  Values are in terms of valuation to BTC.  .001 BTC would represent 1/1000 of a Bitcoin.

The right column represents the percent change for a 24-hour period between the "high" value and "low" value.

***Step 5:***

Click on a coin pair and a window will pop up.  From this window you can "buy" or "sell".  We operate on an auto-sell technique that uses
Bittrex.com to post your sale, so that it happens as soon as your desired net profit (Percent Change) is realized.


***OTHER NOTES***

The upper-left table represents the highest-value "alt-coin" coin pairs for the last 24 hours.

The upper right "web view" represents the 5 most popular tweets for "#Cryptocurrency".

The information to the right of the logo represents your usename and your Bittrex balance in terms of Bitcoin.

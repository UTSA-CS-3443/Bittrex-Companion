Richard's notes/project log

[10-24-2017]

	Testing to see if I can pull and push stuff properly. (I'm late to the party)
	Once I go through what code we have so far, I will start making the template for 
	the UML documentation. My main task is documenting our project while helping assist 
	with the UI and the implementation of our algorithms to produce reliable information
	for our user.   
	
	- Hunter is the lead that'll implement api's and assist where we fall short.
	- Jerome is in charge of the algorithmic trading and vision of the application. 
	- Michael will be creating the GUI and how we output information to our users.
	- Oscar will assist with various methods and prepare the presentation.
	- Richard is creating the UML and tinkering with other members code.

	I found a website for bitcoin news: https://news.bitcoin.com/
	We can use that to pull for the News Box, maybe. If someone else
	finds something else that works better, post it so we can take a look

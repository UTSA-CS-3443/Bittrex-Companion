	Testing to see if I can pull and push stuff properly. (I'm late to the party)
	Once I go through what code we have so far, I will start making the template for 
	the UML documentation. My main task is documenting our project while helping assist 
	with the UI and the implementation of our algorithms to produce reliable information
	for our user.   
	
	- Hunter is the lead that'll implement api's and assist where we fall short.
	- Jerome is in charge of the algorithmic trading and vision of the application. 
	- Michael will be creating the GUI and how we output information to our users.
	- Oscar will assist with various methods and prepare the presentation.
	- Richard is creating the UML and tinkering with other members code.

	I found a website for bitcoin news: https://news.bitcoin.com/
	We can use that to pull for the News Box, maybe. If someone else
	finds something else that works better, post it so we can take a look

	This is officially called the "Project Log" now. Anyone can write and make use of this. 
	We can update each other with feedback on specific code or give a status of what we are 
	working on and etc. It's 12:11 AM and I had to reset my local repository so I could pull 
	and push again. I'll start making the UML today and i'll place it somewhere in here if 
	possible? So as a team, let's communicate better and be transparent with each other.
	
	Hunter! Give me workable input that I can put into the register screen so that I can
	go to the next screen. I get "Invalid value passed upon creation error messages".
	Help me man. (probably has to due with my api key & secret).
	
	- Richard

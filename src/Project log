	Testing to see if I can pull and push stuff properly. (I'm late to the party)
	Once I go through what code we have so far, I will start making the template for 
	the UML documentation. My main task is documenting our project while helping assist 
	with the UI and the implementation of our algorithms to produce reliable information
	for our user.   
	
	- Hunter is the lead that'll implement api's and assist where we fall short.
	- Jerome is in charge of the algorithmic trading and vision of the application. 
	- Michael will be creating the GUI and how we output information to our users.
	- Oscar will assist with various methods and prepare the presentation.
	- Richard is creating the UML and tinkering with other members code.

	I found a website for bitcoin news: https://news.bitcoin.com/
	We can use that to pull for the News Box, maybe. If someone else
	finds something else that works better, post it so we can take a look

	This is officially called the "Project Log" now. Anyone can write and make use of this. 
	We can update each other with feedback on specific code or give a status of what we are 
	working on and etc. It's 12:11 AM and I had to reset my local repository so I could pull 
	and push again. I'll start making the UML today and i'll place it somewhere in here if 
	possible? So as a team, let's communicate better and be transparent with each other.
	
	Hunter! I know we use this for the register and login. But is this apikey like tied
	to a real bittrex account or something or just a key to communicate to the bittrex
	website to grab information?
	
	//String apikey = "efbb2db14372420cb999b867e289c692";
	//String apisecret = "56c6a978e67544c6a34a7abe9fb64e45";

	I think it's time I start pushing stuff. I'll have a semi-finished UML done tonight since I 
	need to review types of relationships and association that our classes have with one
	another. Please give me feed back or change what you see fit in the UML. The UML will 
	overall be wrapped up by the end of Friday. Feel free to tweak the project in anyway you 
	see fit. I need to push some actual code so I'll be messing with the UI and adding stuff
	to help the user out. Thinking of implementing FAQ button with a new window, adding the 
	current Bit-coin to USD exchange rate, a walk through of how we select the potential coins.
	
	When we meet today we should decide when everything must be wrapped up for the code to 
	be turned in and fill out the README. Maybe set the deadline to make any last adjustments on
	Sunday night, update UML Monday and submit the code together at the library on Tuesday.
